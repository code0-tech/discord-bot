<h1>Code0 Discord Bot</h1>
</div>

### Basic Overview:

Code0 is a Discord bot developed in JavaScript, utilizing the discord.js client library along with a lightweight web server for GitHub OAuth authentication. This enables certain commands, such as retrieving commit and pull request data.


### Requirements:

- HTTP Port: Required for GitHub OAuth, configured via `http-config.port` in `http-config.json`.

- MongoDB: Used for storing user and bot-related data.

## Tracking

The bot collects and processes certain statistics, as visible in the source code:

- Message Statistics: Number of messages, words, and characters sent.
- Voice Statistics: Join/leave events, channel switches, and total voice time.

## GitHub OAuth
For /open-contributer, OAuth URLs are not stored. This means authentication is required each time the command is executed.

## Code Quality & Development Philosophy
Software is always evolving, and Code0 is no exception. Hereâ€™s why code may sometimes appear incomplete or unpolished:

1. Rapid Development: The goal is to ensure functionality first.
2. Changing Requirements: Features are frequently adjusted to meet new needs.
3. Ongoing Refinements: Code is continuously improved for efficiency and maintainability.
4. Organized Messiness: While some sections may seem unstructured, they function correctly. Any outstanding issues are documented in TODO (index.js).
5. Fast-Paced Changes: In the early stages, speed often takes priority over perfection.

Since Code0 is actively in development, expect ongoing improvements and changes.
## Nicusch Versioning System (NVS)
- `0.0.1` â€“ Minor bug fixes or small functional improvements.
- `0.1.0` â€“ Command modifications or updates that impact functionality.
- `1.0.0` â€“ Major changes affecting class structures and breaking compatibility.

ðŸ’¡ This system has been in use since 10.07.2024, but earlier commits may not follow it consistently.
## Know issues
