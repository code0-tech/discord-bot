## Code0

### Basic Overview:

This this the Discord Bot for Code0 running in javascript.
#
The Bot is running the Discord.js Client instance and a small Web-Server for Github o-auth in order to perform some commands which includes reading commits and pull's.

For that reason a Http Port is required and currently set to `http-config.port` => 7581

Also a MongoDb is required as this Bot needs some DataBase to store Data
